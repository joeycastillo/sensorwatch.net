The Stopwatch face provides basic stopwatch functionality with one-second resolution: you can start and stop the stopwatch with the alarm button. Pressing the light button when the timer is stopped resets it. 

This watch face does not support lap functionality, and it does not count sub-seconds. There is a `fast_stopwatch` watch face by Andreas Nebinger that supports the full stopwatch functionality in a classic Casio F-91W, but note that it consumes about triple the typical power budget when running. As such, we opted to include this pared-down version in the standard firmware.
