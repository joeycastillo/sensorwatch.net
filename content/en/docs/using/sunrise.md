This watch face displays local sunrise and sunset times. During the day, it displays today's sunset; at night, it displays tomorrow's sunrise.

When you first see this watch face, it will display “No Loc”, or No Location. This is because your latitude and longitude are required to calculate sunrise and sunset. When on this screen, you can set your location in a similar way to the World Clock screen.

Press and hold Alarm to enter location setting mode. The top line will read “LA” (Latitude), and the bottom line “+ 0000”. The large digits are the whole number part of the latitude, and the smaller digits (in the seconds place) are the fractional part. 

Note that on the custom LCD, you'll see “LAT” on top and “00.00° N”, which will make this screen clearer. Also note that on the classic LCD, you set the sign (+ or -) first, whereas on the custom LCD, you set the hemisphere (N, S, E or W) last.

Enter your latitude and longitude (“LO”) by pressing the Alarm button to change the sign or advance the digits, and the Light button to move to the next character. On the classic LCD, you can read a latitude of (say) 40.73° N as “+ 40<small>73</small>”, and a longitude of 73.94° W would be “–073<small>94</small>”.

Once you have set your latitude and longitude, the Sunrise/Sunset face will display the next sunrise or sunset on the bottom row, and the day of that sunrise or sunset at the top right.

A short press on the Alarm button will advance to the following sunrise or sunset: for example, on Monday afternoon, it will display Monday evening’s sunset, but a short press on the Alarm button will display Tuesday morning’s sunrise.

If you made a mistake while entering your location, or if you simply wish to change your location, you can re-enter location setting mode with another long press on the Alarm button.
