The Moon Phase face is similar to the Sunrise/Sunset face: it displays the current phase of the moon, along with the day of the month. On the custom LCD, it displays "WAX" and "WAN" for a waxing or waning moon. On the classic LCD it displays a rudimentary graphical representation of the moon on the top row.

This graphical representation is a bit abstract. The segments that turn on represent the shape of the moon, waxing from the bottom right and waning at the top left. A small crescent at the bottom right will grow into a larger crescent, then add lines in the center for a quarter and half moon. All segments are on during a full moon. Then gradually the segments at the bottom right will turn off, until all that remains is a small waning crescent at the top left.

All segments turn off during a new moon.

On this screen you may press the Alarm button repeatedly to move forward in time: the day of the month at the top right will advance by one day for each button press, and both the text and the graphical representation will display the moon phase for that day. Try pressing the Alarm button 27 times now, just to visualize what the moon will look like over the next month.
