The World Clock watch face looks similar to the Simple Clock watch face, but you'll notice that at first launch the day of week indicators are blank. That's because this watch face does not display the day of the week. Instead, you may customize these letters to display the name of a time zone of your choosing.

To customize this watch face, press and hold the Alarm button. The first letter in the top row will begin flashing. Press the Alarm button repeatedly to advance through the available letters in the first slot, then press the Light button to move to the second letter. If you have the [custom LCD](/docs/firmware/customlcd), you can set a third letter as well.

Finally, press Light again to move to the time zone setting, and press Alarm to cycle through the available time zones. Rather than displaying time zone offsets from UTC, this watch face expects you to select a place that matches your time zone rules. For more information, [see the Time Zones in Movement](/docs/using/timeset/#time-zones-in-movement) section in the Time Set documentation.

When you're done selecting a time zone, press Light one last time to return to the world clock display.

Note that on the classic Casio LCD, the second letter position cannot display all letters or numbers.
