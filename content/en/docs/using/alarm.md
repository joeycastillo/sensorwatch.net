This watch face implements a basic daily alarm:

* Press the ALARM button to toggle the alarm on or off. An indicator at the top left will energize to show the alarm state.
* Long press the ALARM button to enter setting mode and adjust the alarm time. 
    * In this mode, pressing ALARM advances the hour, minute or second.
    * Pressing LIGHT advances to the next field.
    * When you finish setting the alarm time, the alarm will automatically be turned on if it was off before.

The alarm status will also be indicated on the main Clock face, but not on any other watch faces.
