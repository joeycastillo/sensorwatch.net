**Not sure where to start?** If you bought a Sensor Watch board on Crowd Supply and need to assemble it, follow the instructions in the video below. But first, read these two notes:

Did you also get a Sensor Board?
--------------------------------

If you have a sensor board (such as the Temperature Sensor included with most early orders), **you must install it first**, before you begin the steps in the video. Your sensor board will come packaged with instructions describing how to install it in the Sensor Watch 9-pin connector.

Do you want to install alternate firmware?
------------------------------------------

Sensor Watch ships with a build of Movement that includes a Clock and World Clock, as well as a Sunrise/Sunset and Moon Phase complication (backer boards also include a Temperature watch face). If you wish to install an [alternate firmware](/docs/firmware/prebuilt/), you should download it and install it before installing your Sensor Watch board in the watch case, as installing it in the watch case renders the USB port inaccessible. Instructions for flashing new firmware [can be found here](/docs/firmware/flashing/).
