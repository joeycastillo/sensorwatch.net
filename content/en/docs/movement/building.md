Install the cross-compiling toolchain on Linux
----------------------------------------------

* Debian/Ubuntu: `apt install gcc-arm-none-eabi libnewlib-arm-none-eabi`

* Archlinux: `pacman -S arm-none-eabi-gcc arm-none-eabi-newlib`

Other Linux:

* Download the [GNU ARM Embedded Toolchain for 64-bit Linux](https://developer.arm.com/-/media/Files/downloads/gnu-rm/10.3-2021.10/gcc-arm-none-eabi-10.3-2021.10-x86_64-linux.tar.bz2?rev=78196d3461ba4c9089a67b5f33edf82a&hash=5631ACEF1F8F237389F14B41566964EC)
* Extract it: `tar xjf gcc-arm-none-eabi-10.3-2021.10-x86_64-linux.tar.bz2`
* Add it to your PATH: `export PATH="$PATH:/path/to/extracted/gcc-arm-none-eabi-10.3-2021.10/bin"`

Note: if you want, you can add the above PATH export to your shell's startup script to make it persist between shell invocations

Install the cross-compiling toolchain on MacOS
----------------------------------------------

* Download the [GNU ARM Embedded Toolchain for 64-bit MacOS](https://developer.arm.com/-/media/Files/downloads/gnu-rm/10.3-2021.10/gcc-arm-none-eabi-10.3-2021.10-mac.pkg?rev=b382d51ec8d34c3fa421cf57ce97f146&hash=86689FEB39DA7A381FF78A2E70F7ABCE)
* Double-click the installer and follow the prompts to install the toolchain
* Add the toolchain to your PATH: `export PATH="$PATH:/Applications/ARM/bin"`

Note: if you want, you can add the above PATH export to your shell's startup script to make it persist between shell invocations

Install the cross-compiling toolchain on Windows
------------------------------------------------

* Download the [GNU ARM Embedded Toolchain for Windows](https://developer.arm.com/-/media/Files/downloads/gnu-rm/10.3-2021.10/gcc-arm-none-eabi-10.3-2021.10-win32.exe?rev=29bb46cfa0434fbda93abb33c1d480e6&hash=B2C5AAE07841929A0D0BF460896D6E52)

* Install
* On the final screen choose the option to add to path
* if you dont, then the readme has instructions to set the path

* Download [GnuCoreUtilities](https://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/coreutils.htm)

* Install and add to path
* `set PATH="C:\Program Files (x86)\GnuWin32\bin";%PATH%`

* Create an alias 
* `doskey gmkdir="C:\Program Files (x86)\GnuWin32\bin\mkdir" $*`

* Download [GnuMake](https://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm)

* Install and add to path
* `set PATH="C:\Program Files (x86)\GnuWin32\bin";%PATH%`	

* Download [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/)

* Install and add to path
* Create an alias
* `doskey python3="C:\Users\dgran\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python312\python" $*`

Compile firmware
----------------

* From within the [repo](https://github.com/joeycastillo/second-movement):
* `make BOARD=X DISPLAY=y`, with X and Y replaced with the following:
    * For Sensor Watch Pro boards `make BOARD=sensorwatch_pro`
    * For Sensor Watch Lite boards `make BOARD=sensorwatch_red`
    * For classic green or blue boards, `make BOARD=sensorwatch_green` or `make BOARD=sensorwatch_blue`
    * If you are using the original LCD that came with the Casio, add `DISPLAY=classic`
    * Otherwise, add `DISPLAY=custom`

The built firmware will be at `build/firmware.uf2`. You can now [flash](/docs/firmware/flashing) this firmware to your watch.

"I just want to pick my own set of watchfaces"
----------------------------------------------

The list of included watchfaces can be found in the `watch_faces` array in `movement_config.h`. Simply add, remove, and/or rearrange faces in this list to your liking and re-compile/re-flash your firmware.

An official web-based builder for Second Movement, forked from the previous unofficial online firmware builder, is forthcoming. Watch this space.
